CorpusTools 1.1.0 Release Notes
*******************************

This is a major version release for Phonological CorpusTools.

Importing corpora
=================

* Importing corpora functionality in the GUI received a large overhaul
* All types of corpora are imported through a single dialog
* PCT should autodetect many settings based on selected files or directories
* Autodetected settings can be edited and refined by the user
* Basic logging support saves parsing details entered by the user (i.e.,
  multicharacter segments)
* Numbers in transcriptions can be parsed as stress, tone, or as a normal
  character (note that tone and stress are currently not supported in functions
  or phonological search)

Pronunciation variants
======================

* All algorithms that analyze segments support four strategies for dealing with
  pronunciation variants: canonical forms, most frequent variants, separated
  tokens as types, and tokens weighted by their relative frequenies
* Algorithms that analyze words support two strategies for pronunciation
  variants: canonical forms and most frequent variants
* Exporting corpora can now export pronunciation variants (and their frequencies)

Functional load
===============

* Added support for finding the average functional load of single segments

Phonotactic probability
=======================

* Fixed an issue where calculating biphone probabilities on single segment
  words would cause errors; now assigns a probability of 0 to those words

Kullback-Leibler divergence
===========================

* Added options to bring KL divergence in line with the other functions
* Added command line script for calculating KL divergence

GUI
===

* Added a dialog to the "View/change feature system" dialog to edit the
  categorization of segments into a coherent segment chart via features
* Features can be used as input to the analysis functions, i.e. functional load
  of voice in the corpus (segements that are +voice compared to segments that
  are -voice)

Segment selection
-----------------

* Segment selection has been redone
* Segments can be selected via the inventory
* Features can be typed into the filter field, which will highlight
  segments that will be included with that feature selection
* Once a feature specification has been entered, that segment set can
  be locked in

Environments
------------

* Environment creation has been revamped
* Users can select a set of center segments
* Right hand and left hand can be added, with multiple sets of segments
  on each side

Known issues
------------

* Help pages for the Mac binary require internet connection to view, due
  to issues including .html files in the .app binary
