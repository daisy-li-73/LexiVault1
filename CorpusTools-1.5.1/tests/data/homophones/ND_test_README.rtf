\f0\fs24 \cf0 Tests for Neighbourhood Density with a File Containing Words\
\
(A) files contain only words that do also happen to occur in the corpus\
(B) files contain only words that do not occur in the corpus\
(C) files contain both words that do occur and words that don\'92t occur in the corpus\
\
(1) files contain spelling\
(3) files contain transcription\
\
Note that in PCT, if the file contains spelling, the tier for calculation MUST be spelling as well, and if the file contains transcription, the tier for calculation MUST be transcription as well. PCT will automatically change the tier to match what the file is.\
\
Expected results from the Example corpus, not collapsing homophones in any cases:\
\
A1: 4, 4, 4, 1\
A3: 5, 5, 5, 1\
B1: 1, 2, 1\
B3: 5, 5, 2\
C1: 4, 4, 4, 1, 1, 2, 1\
C3: 5, 5, 5, 1, 5, 5, 2}
